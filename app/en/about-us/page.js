            <p>
              Team Up! was born out of a simple observation: remote team
              meetings don&apos;t have to be boring, disconnected experiences.
              In 2021, as remote work became the new normal, we noticed that
              while tools for video calls and chat were abundant, there was
              nothing that truly replicated the spatial, collaborative nature of
              in-person meetings.
            </p>
            <p>
              We set out to create virtual spaces that would not only facilitate
              productive meetings but would also foster the human connection
              that&apos;s often missing in remote work. Our goal wasn&apos;t to
              just build another video conferencing tool, but to create virtual
              environments where teams could collaborate, socialize, and have
              funâ€”just like they would in physical spaces.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, Team Up! is used by teams in over 30 countries, helping
              them to connect, collaborate, and build stronger relationships
              regardless of physical distance. We continue to innovate with new
              spaces and features, always guided by our mission to make remote
              work more human.
